# Ranking-college-basketball-teams


Use the data in the attached ‘ACCGames1819.csv’ file containing box-score information on ACC games from this season to develop a predictive ranking of ACC teams. The final ranking should be predictive in the sense that a team ranked better according to your ranking would be projected to beat a worse-ranked team (at a neutral site). Please rank all ACC teams and return the ranking (best team 1 to worst team 15) in a file with the title ‘ACCRankings1819.csv’. Creating a predictive rating for each team is optional, but if used, please include this information as a column in the same csv file. The attached ‘ExampleRankings.csv’ file gives an example of the desired output format using the real 2018-2019 ACC standings (and conference win percentage as the rating). Please share any code used to develop your rankings, as the purpose of this open-ended question is to see your thought process through a realistic sports modeling problem.
